## Introduction

Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. Turk-NLP provides a suite of tools tailored for Turkish, making it easier to analyze and understand text data. Whether you are a researcher, student, or developer, Turk-NLP offers the functionalities you need to work with Turkish text.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Break down text into words or phrases.
- **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identify the grammatical categories of words.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Detect and classify named entities in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment expressed in text.
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of longer texts.
- **Morphological Analysis**: Analyze the structure of words.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilize state-of-the-art models from Hugging Face.

## Installation

To install Turk-NLP, clone the repository and install the required packages. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anu-Prabha-Joseph/Turk-NLP.git
cd Turk-NLP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using Turk-NLP in your projects. Below is a simple example of how to use the library for tokenization:

```python
from turk_nlp import Tokenizer

text = "Merhaba, d√ºnya!"
tokenizer = Tokenizer()
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
```

For more detailed examples and advanced usage, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Available Tools

Turk-NLP offers various tools to assist with different NLP tasks. Here‚Äôs a brief overview:

### Tokenization

Tokenization splits text into smaller units, such as words or sentences. This is often the first step in NLP tasks.

### Lemmatization

Lemmatization converts words to their base forms. For example, "ko≈üuyorum" becomes "ko≈ü".

### Part-of-Speech Tagging

This tool tags each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, or adjective.

### Named Entity Recognition

NER identifies entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, or locations.

### Sentiment Analysis

This feature analyzes text to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

### Text Summarization

Summarization condenses lengthy texts into shorter, more digestible summaries.

### Morphological Analysis

This tool analyzes the structure of words, providing insights into their components.

### Deep Learning Models

Leverage advanced models from Hugging Face for various NLP tasks.
